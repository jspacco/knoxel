# Knoxel JS: A Voxel-based browser coding experience

## TODO
* Should we name it Knoxcraft after all? Knoxel / KnoxelJS is probably more unique
* Instructions
    * Show all of the possible textures
    * demo what it does with pictures
    * FAQ
    * BlueJ/JGrasp support
* Turn debugging on/off for some console messages with a setting that we can flip in knoxel.js
* Better error handling for bad JSON files
* Textures!
    * standardize textures
        * common list of textures in one place that gets turned into javascript and Python
    * everything through LAPIS_LAZULI_ORE works, nothing after it works
    * Need a way to list/show textures, possibly in a separate tab
    * Add textures of various colors that we can just kind of drop in
        * https://www.pixilart.com/draw/16x16-b3bc604165f0096
        * my red, pink are probably wrong?
* clicking should reveal the names of textures somehow
* grid outline of the whole thing that we just dropped into place as debugging
* draw text onto the screen anywhere? what else can we do with voxel?
    * check @deathcap's fork, it seems more up to date than maxogden
        * would need to figure out how to import into node_modules from github?
* generate links to programs using the URL somehow
* Turn on Google analytics!
* Use the item menu bar to show coordinates of things we click on?
* get rid of the little status thing, it's annoying
* fix webgl errors
* check other voxeljs features to see what else we might want to add
* Placeholders for student-side debugging (width, depth, height, blocks, etc)
* fix ACE error handling 
    * highlighting line numbers for errors
* BlueJ/JGrasp Java support

## Stretch Goals
* Java to Javascript transpiler for this project
    * What Java features do we need?
        * arrays
        * Map
        * ArrayList / LinkedList (anything from the List interface)
        *
