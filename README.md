# Knoxel JS: A Voxel-based browser coding experience

## TODO
* Python/pykc support
* Should we name it Knoxcraft after all? Knoxel / KnoxelJS is probably more unique
* About page
* Instructions
* put onto `jspacco.github.io` as an SPA?
    * not really an SPA, it has a lot of files, so it's a sub-folder in _site
* Update `jspacco.github.io`
* Test textures!
* enum-like thing in JS for easy of use
    * knoxel.blockType.DIRT or knoxel.DIRT
* Do all textures in a big example
* grid outline of the whole thing that we just dropped into place
* draw text onto the screen anywhere?
* get rid of the little status thing, it's annoying
* Placeholders for student-side debugging
* BlueJ/JGrasp Java support

## Stretch Goals
* Java to Javascript transpiler for this project
    * What Java features do we need?
        * arrays
        * Map
        * ArrayList / LinkedList (anything from the List interface)
        *
