# Knoxel JS: A Voxel-based browser coding experience

## TODO
* Python/pykc support, try to integrate directly into knoxel.js backend
* Should we name it Knoxcraft after all? Knoxel / KnoxelJS is probably more unique
* About page (grab MC images of former students)
* Instructions
    * Show all of the possible textures
* put onto `jspacco.github.io`
    * it has a lot of files, so some kind of sub-folder in _site
    * Update `jspacco.github.io` while we're at it
* Textures!
    * everything through LAPIS_LAZULI_ORE works, nothing after it works
    * Need a way to list/show textures, possibly in a separate tab
* enum-like thing in JS for easy of use
    * knoxel.blockType.DIRT or knoxel.DIRT
* clicking should reveal the names of textures somehow
* grid outline of the whole thing that we just dropped into place as debugging
* draw text onto the screen anywhere? what else can we do with voxel?
    * check @deathcap's fork, it seems more up to date than maxogden
        * would need to figure out how to import into node_modules from github?
* get rid of the little status thing, it's annoying
* check other voxeljs features to see what else we might want to add
* Placeholders for student-side debugging (width, depth, height, blocks, etc)
* BlueJ/JGrasp Java support

## Stretch Goals
* Java to Javascript transpiler for this project
    * What Java features do we need?
        * arrays
        * Map
        * ArrayList / LinkedList (anything from the List interface)
        *
