        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a></b> is a popular voxel-based game 
        played by millions around the world. Knoxel brings the joy of Minecraft to CS0/CS1!
        </p>
        <p>
        With <a href="https://jspacco.github.io/knoxel">Knoxel</a> you write code 
        in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, or Java to manipulate 3D arrays of blocks,
        then visualize your creations in a voxel-based world, right there in your web browser!
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="https://jspacco.github.io/knoxel">Knoxel</a> is free, with no software to install for the faculty or the student!
        </p>
        <p>
            We make everything happen in your browser through the magic of Javascript and 
            a healthy amount of cursing!
        </p>

            <td>Students write code in Javascript, Python, Ruby, or Java to 
                manipulate 3D arrays of blocks. We provide enums or enum-like 
                constants for each language to make this process simple.
                Students can then render and view their creations in their web browser!

                I usually give them some sample programs and a week to craft their drawings.

                <p>
                The instructions are usually something like,
                "Make a house! A house should have a roof and a door and a hollow space inside."
                They can interpret what "house" means in a variety of different, interesting ways.

                    Compiler and runtime error messages through Knoxel are different than what 
                    students see with their IDE.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Students cannot save code written into the browser, so they might lose their work!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some students do not like open-ended assignments lacking a single right answer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We have not gotten Java support working in the browser, so they need to run it 
                    offline and upload a file it produces. This is how I use the system in CS1, and
                    it's not a problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lava, water, and other things that "flow" in regular Minecraft do not actually flow in Knoxel
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can't actually do any of the things you can do in Minecraft, like mine
                    or place blocks, except by writing code. Faculty tend to like this feature, 
                    students may not.

                    <li>
                        Make parameterized structures, like "a function to create a tower where the 
                        height works for any multiple of 4". 
                    </li>

                        Make specific structures.

                    <li>
                        Ask students to create the utility functions that 
                        create a 3D array of null with given dimensions, or
                        to convert a 3D array into JSON.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JSON files describing the blocks in a 3D array might be
                        a good way to talk about data exchange formats, but I have not
                        tried that yet.
